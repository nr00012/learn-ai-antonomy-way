# Day 05 – Linear Algebra with Vectors ➕➡️

## Why Vectors Matter in AI?
- Data points, word embeddings, images = all vectors!
- Vectors define directions and magnitudes in high-dimensional spaces.
- Foundation for neural network computations.

## What You'll Practice
- Create vectors with NumPy
- Compute magnitude (norm)
- Normalize a vector
- Dot product & cosine similarity (measure similarity)
- Visualize vectors (2D)
