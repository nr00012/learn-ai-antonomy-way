## ✅ Micro Task – Day 05: Vector Playground

1. Create two 2D vectors: `a = [3, 4]`, `b = [1, 2]`
2. Compute:
   - Magnitude of `a`
   - Normalized `a`
   - Dot product `a · b`
   - Cosine similarity between `a` and `b`
3. Visualize both vectors on a 2D plane using matplotlib.

Bonus: Try two random 5D vectors and compute cosine similarity.
